# SizeMe React

A [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)-app, build and packaged with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) (or npm, that should work also):

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn start` to build dev version once
3. `yarn watch` to serve dev version on http://localhost:8080 and build automatically on file change
3. `yarn build` to build prod version

File [_index.html_](http://localhost:8080) is a test file, containing a static copy of a product page at 
https://www.sizemedemo.com/magento19/t-shirt-db.html.
